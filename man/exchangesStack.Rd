\title{Plot the exchanges of an area}
\usage{
exchangesStack(x, area = NULL, mcYear = "average", dateRange = NULL,
  colors = NULL, main = NULL, ylab = NULL, unit = c("MWh", "GWh",
  "TWh"), interactive = getInteractivity(), legend = TRUE,
  legendId = sample(1e+09, 1), legendItemsPerRow = 5, width = NULL,
  height = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{antaresData} created with function
\code{\link[antaresRead]{readAntares}}. It is required to contain link data.
If it also contains area data with column `ROW BAL.`, then exchanges with
the rest of the world are also displayed on the chart.}

\item{area}{Name of a single area. The flows from/to this area will be drawn by the
function.}

\item{mcYear}{If \code{x}, contains multiple Monte-Carlo scenarios, this parameter 
determine which scenario is displayed. Must be an integer representing the
index of the scenario or the word "average". In this case data are 
averaged.}

\item{dateRange}{A vector of two dates. Only data points between these two dates are 
displayed. If NULL, then all data is displayed.}

\item{colors}{Vector of colors with same length as parameter \code{variables}. If 
\code{variables} is an alias, then this argument should be \code{NULL} in 
order to use default colors.}

\item{main}{Title of the graph.}

\item{ylab}{Title of the Y-axis.}

\item{unit}{Unit used in the graph. Possible values are "MWh", "GWh" or "TWh".}

\item{interactive}{LogicalValue. If \code{TRUE}, then a shiny gadget is launched that lets
the user interactively choose the areas or districts to display.}

\item{legend}{Logical value indicating if a legend should be drawn. This argument is 
usefull when one wants to create a shared legend with
\code{\link{prodStackLegend}}}

\item{legendId}{Id of the legend linked to the graph. This argument is 
usefull when one wants to create a shared legend with
\code{\link{prodStackLegend}}}

\item{legendItemsPerRow}{Number of elements to put in each row of the legend.}

\item{width}{Width of the graph expressed in pixels or in percentage of 
the parent element. For instance "500px" and "100\%" are valid values.}

\item{height}{Height of the graph expressed in pixels or in percentage of 
the parent element. For instance "500px" and "100\%" are valid values.}
}
\value{
A htmlwidget of class \code{dygraph}. It can be modified with functions from
package \code{dygraphs}.
}
\description{
This function draws a stack representing the evolution of the exchanges of
an area with its neighbours. Positive values denotes exports and negative 
values imports.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
mydata <- readAntares(links = "all", timeStep = "daily")
exchangeStack(mydata)

# Also display exchanges with the rest of the world
mydata <- readAntares(areas = "all", links = "all", timeStep = "daily")
exchangesStack(mydata)
}
